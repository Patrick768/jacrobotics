		<p> Here we will have all the different people who are involved in our club, even those who never showed up when we actually had work to do... I'm looking at you _____.</p>
		
		Here we will have peoples pictures, and what they did (or were supposed to do) for our club.

			<td> An artist among nerds, she invested herself in the conception and construction of the kiosk. Helena was also strangely aggressive about the stains we needed. And everything else, too.</td>

			<td>			This guy's motivation (or insanity) knows no bounds. He graciously accepted to act as John Abbott's Dean for our video, and wore the same suit for three days. He also jumped in a lake in the middle of December. "Communism".			</td>
			<td>			Programmed for CRC’s ridiculous programming competition (she had to go all the way to Westmount for that!!). She also filmed our video. I tried microwaving her tourtière once and the microwave stopped working.			</td>
