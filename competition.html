		<p> Well this year they've gone from shuffleboard to 3D Chess... so that means half the teams will be flopping around like fishes out of water (us included).</p>
		
		<p>Two teams, one blue, and the other one yellow, of two robots each are competing against each other, with the goal of obtaining a maximum of points. The robots have to get game pieces, or footballs, into given targets of their assigned colors: cylinders, prisms, or v-shaped targets. Game pieces can be acquired at 8 different dispensers over the playing field. Robots also have to drop the pieces into 2 different multipliers: the Quad-Core multiplier and the 3-level multiplier. The team with the most game pieces in the Quad-core multiplier(in the middle) can obtain up to twice as much points. The 3 level multiplier can contain up to 3 GP, and only increases the number of points of the V-shaped targets. </p>
